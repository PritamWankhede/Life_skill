# 1. What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a way to learn better by explaining something in very simple words, like teaching it to a child. 
If you find it hard to explain, it means you don’t fully understand it. Then, you study more and try again until it’s clear. This helps you learn deeply and remember better.

# 2. Most Interesting Idea
The two interesting ideas are focus and relaxed thinking, which improve how we set our goals.  
- Focused thinking helps us concentrate on one thing.  
- Relaxed thinking lets our mind wander and connect different ideas.  
Switching between these two types of thinking can improve our understanding and problem-solving skills, which was a simple yet powerful way to approach learning.

# 3. Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking
- **Active Thinking:** Paying close attention and solving problems in a detailed way.  
- **Diffused Thinking:** Letting your mind relax and think freely, which helps with creativity and seeing the big picture.

# 4. Steps to Approach a New Topic
- Pick a clear topic to learn.  
- Break it down into smaller sections.  
- Look for helpful resources to learn more.  
- Practice and use what you’ve learned.  
- Review and change your understanding if needed.

# 5. Actions to Improve Your Learning
- Set clear goals for your learning.  
- Use active methods like summarizing what you’ve learned or teaching it to others.  
- Practice regularly with breaks between sessions (spaced repetition).  
- Change your learning techniques to match how you learn best.
