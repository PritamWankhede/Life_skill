# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1 - What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

1. **Pay Attention**: Fully focus on the person speaking and avoid distractions like your phone or other tasks.
2. **Don’t Interrupt**: Let the speaker finish before you respond.
3. **Show Interest**: Use small words like “Okay” or “I see” and nod to show you’re listening.
4. **Repeat Back**: Summarize or repeat what you heard to check your understanding.
5. **Write Key Points**: Take short notes if needed to remember important details.
6. **Use Open Body Language**: Sit straight, make eye contact, and avoid crossing your arms to look approachable.

## Question 2 - According to Fisher’s model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Obstacles I face while listening include:
- **Getting Distracted**: Noise, multitasking, or thinking about other things.
